geo arena plan

- what's the target audience?
  - casual audience => guidance
  - enthusiasts => challenge, original ideas

- important factors to make people play the game:
  - onboarding => tutorial, campaign mode, story
  - scoring => 
  - difficulty => multiple diff levels/ranks

- what's the vision?

*** gameplay
- each level has a timer (10 minutes?)
- in the allotted time the player must:
  - capture at least 51% of the level squares (side reward establish a safe zone and get powerups)
  - stay alive by defeating enemies
  - collect special loot dropped by enemies (to get different forms (line, zig zag, angle, square))
- level is finished when the timer reaches 0
- at specific intervals:
  - enemies spawn and behave in a specific way according to their type
  - enemies aggro the player when he tries capturing squares
  - enemies of the same type defend their comrades when aggroed
  - powerups spawn in pseudo-random grid cell positions

*** game modes 
  - arcade -> 3 or 4 levels in a specific arena form and then a boss (square arena, cross, isles, 2 rectangles separated by bridges)
  - battle royale -> choose arena, 2 or more players, choose powers etc.
  - infinite mode -> player retains powers between levels

- bonus powers : speed, capture speed, shoot
- rare bonus : x3 size, god mode, quad damage,

- monster types : stationary, roaming fast and slow, shooting, sneaker

- boss monsters are adapted to each arena form
